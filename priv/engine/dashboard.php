<p>After clicking the play button, you can join to a game. Try to join to a game with players as it is bit boring to play alone.</p>

<p>Your objective is to <b>collect as many hearts as possible</b> before the round time runs out.</p>

<p>You can move the blue box (<img src='img/player.bmp'/>) with the controls on right side of the screen</p>

<p>There is LOTS of lag. I know it and I cant really do anything for it. The game is hosted on normal shared hosting account and the average ping is 150-200ms... Think about playing quake without lag compensation with that lag.</p>
